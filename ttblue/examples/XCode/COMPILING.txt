Note

To successfully compile these Xcode projects, you will need to do one of the following:

1) Move the project into the same folder as the example Xcode projects in the Cycling '74's MaxMSP SDK.

2) Move a copy of the c74support folder from the SDK in to the Xcode folder in the examples folder that comes with Tap.Tools Blue

3) Change the appropriate paths in the Xcode project to point to whatever location you have placed your c74support folder.


The easiest will probably be one 2nd option above.
