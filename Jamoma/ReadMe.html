<h3>Installing</h3>

<ol>
	<li>
		Place the <code>Jamoma</code> folder in your Max searchpath
		(such as in the Cycling '74 folder).
	</li>
	<li>
		If you are using Windows:
		<ul>
			<li>Three DLL files are required.  They must be placed into the "support" folder in your Max application's folder.  
				These three files are located deep in the Jamoma folder and must be moved:
				<ul>
					<li>iconv.dll - located in Jamoma\library\externals_3rd_party\libiconv</li>
					<li>zlib1.dll - located in Jamoma\library\externals_3rd_party\libiconv</li>
					<li>libxml2.dll - located in Jamoma\library\externals_3rd_party\libxml2\win32\bin</li>
				</ul>
			</li>	
			<li>
				If you have installed previous versions of Jamoma, please check if there is a file named <code>jamoma-init.txt</code> 
				in your <code>init</code> folder (inside of the
				Cycling '74	folder). If so, delete this.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		If you are using Mac:
		<ul>
			<li>
				If you checked Jamoma out using <a 
				href="http://sourceforge.net/svn/?group_id=78108">SVN</A> 
				(rather than downloading a release from the website):
				<ul>
					<li>
						Unzip (double-click) the 
						<code>build_mac.zip</code> archive located in the
						<code>Jamoma/library/externals</code> folder.
					</li>
					<li>
						Unzip any archives located inside the various subfolders
						of the <code>Jamoma/library/externals_3rd_party</code>
						folder.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>	
			<li>
				If you downloaded a release from the <a 
				href="http://www.jamoma.org">website</A>, ignore the steps
				above.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>	
	<li>
		Move the <code>jcom.meter~</code> external (in 	
		<code>/library/externals/build_mac</code> or 
		<code>/library/externals/build_win</code> depending on your platform)
		into your <code>max-startup</code> folder (inside of the 
		Cycling '74 folder)
	</li>
	<li>
		Check out the Jamoma <a 
		href="documentation/html/index.html">documentation</a>.
	</li>
</ol>

<p>Optional customization you may want to do for your install might include the following:</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		The overview patch 
		(<code>Jamoma/documentation/jamoma-overview.mxt</code>) may be 
		copied to the max-startup folder or in Max's patches/extras folder.
	</li>
	<lI>
		The templates (patches located in 	
		<code>Jamoma/documentation/templates</code>) are most effective when
		copied to Max's patches/templates folder.
	</li>
</ol>

<p>The Jamoma distribution depend on certain 3rd party externals. For simplicity we have chosen to include these externals as part of the distribution. If you already have installed some or all of these externals, make sure that that the Jamoma distribution do not introduce older versions of the externals than you have already. All such externals can be found in the <code>Jamoma/library/externals_3rd_party</code> folder.</P>


<h3>  Requirements</h3>

<ul>
	<li>
		Jamoma requires <a href="http://www.cycling74.com/">Cycling '74's</a> 
		Max version 4.6 or newer (Mac) or version 4.5.7 or newer (Windows).
	</li>
	<li>
		Audio modules require Cycling '74's MSP.
	</li>
	<li>
		Video modules require Cycling '74's Jitter (version 1.5.2 or 
		higher).
	</li>
	<li>
		Some ambisonic modules require both Cycling '74's MSP and Jitter.
	</li>
</ul>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<p> To get started, there is an examples folder in the Jamoma/documentation folder. 
  Trond Lossius has also created some excellent <a href="documentation/html/tutorials/">tutorials</a>. 
  Also, if you are interested in creating your own modules, be sure to check out 
  the <a href="documentation/html/interface_guidelines.html">JIG (Jamoma Interface 
  Guidelines)</a> which is in the documentation folder.</p>

<h3>Known Issues </h3>

<p> The following are the problems of which we are currently aware:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		When a patch is first drawn, the modules may appear block.  Refreshing 	
		the screen by sending the<span class="instructionName"> ;max 
		refresh</span> message or unlocking the patch will resolve the 
		problem.
