/*
 * Prefix header jmod.param Xcode project
 *
 * We have multiple targets for the jmod.param project to produce
 * the jmod.parameter, jmod.message, and jmod.return externals.
 * We do this instead of runtime checks to reduce branching so that
 * the externals should be faster, and also so we don't need an init
 * file in the Max/Cycling '74 folder.
