HOW TO COMPILE THIS OBJECT

Special thanks to Thomas Grill for his assistance with the
initial instruction on how to do this.

User interface objects are different than plain Max objects.  
When compiling on the Mac from CodeWarrior there should be 
difference in the process.  However, using VC++ on Windows
there is a slightly different process.

First, when you compile from VC++, you do not compile directly
to the .mxe file.  Instead, you compile to an intermediary .dll
file.  You then drop into the terminal to combine the .dll with
a resource file to create the .mxe file.  You can do that with
the following command:

	rezwack -d jmod.meter~.dll -r jmod_meter.qtr -o jmod.meter~.mxe


It is possible that the resources have changed, however.  If 
they have changed you will need to recompile them.  To do that,
run this command:

	rez jmod_meter.qtr.txt -o jmod_meter.qtr

That text source may be obtained by taking the resource fork file
on the Mac and running 

	/Developer/Tools/DeRez jmod.meter~.rsrc

HOWEVER: you must delete the MaxL and ckid resources before 
re-compiling.  Otherwise this external will crash!
