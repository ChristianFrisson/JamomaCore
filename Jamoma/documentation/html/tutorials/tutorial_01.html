<h3>Tutorial 1: Introduction</h3>
<p>Jamoma is a proposition for a standard set of guidelines for development of 
  modules in <a href="http://cycling74.com">Max</a>. Jamoma consists of two 
  parts: A <a href="../interface_guidelines.html">recommendation</a> and an implementation 
  of those recommendations. Some of the possible benefits that Jamoma might offer 
  are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Encourage reuse of modules from one project to the next.</li>
  <li>Simplify development in projects involving several artists/developers by 
    offering a common protocol for modules.</li>
  <li>Simplify the creation of clear, flexible and screen-efficient GUI.</li>
  <li>A simple and flexible solution for remote control of the states of parameters 
    in the various patches, including cue handling.</li>
  <li>Possible exchange of patches and modules between Max users in a similar 
    way to how 3rd party externals are currently being made available.</li>
</ul>
<p>Jamoma modules can roughly be subdivided into 3 categories, <em>control</em>, 
  <em>audio</em> and <em>video</em>, in a similar way to the division between 
  Max, MSP and Jitter. Of course you can imagine modules dealing with audio <em>and</em> 
  video, but let's stick to these three categories for the time being. The three 
  different kinds of modules look a bit different, and we've adapted a naming 
  scheme whereby tilde (~) is always part of the name for audio modules, while 
  &quot;%&quot; indicate that you're dealing with a video module:</p>
<p>We'll start out with a very simple control module, and from there you might 
  move on to audio or video modules, depending on your needs and interest.</p>
