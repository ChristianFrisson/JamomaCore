/*
 * Prefix header jcom.param Xcode project

 * We have multiple targets for the jcom.param project to produce
 * the jcom.parameter, jcom.message, and jcom.return externals.
 * We do this instead of runtime checks to reduce branching so that
 * the externals should be faster, and also so we don't need an init
 * file in the Max/Cycling '74 folder.
