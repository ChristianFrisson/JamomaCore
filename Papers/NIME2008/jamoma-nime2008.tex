%
% This example file demonstrates the use of the 'sig-alternate.cls'
% V1.6 LaTeX2e document class file. It is for those submitting
% articles to ACM Conference Proceedings WHO DO NOT WISH TO
% STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE SIGS (PUBS-BOARD-ENDORSED) STYLE.
% The 'sig-alternate.cls' file will produce a similar-looking,

%
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex file (and associated .cls V1.6) produces:
%       1) The Permission Statement
%       2) The Conference (location) Info information
%       3) The Copyright Line with ACM data
%       4) NO page numbers
%
% as against the acm_proc_article-sp.cls file which
% DOES NOT produce 1) thru' 3) above.
%
% Using 'sig-alternate.cls' you have control, however, from within
% the source .tex file, over both the CopyrightYear
% (defaulted to 2002) and the ACM Copyright Data
% (defaulted to X-XXXXX-XX-X/XX/XX).
% e.g.
%\CopyrightYear{2005}   %will cause 2002 to appear in the copyright line.
%\crdata{XXX}   %will cause XXX to appear in the copyright line.
%
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex source is an example which *does* use
% the .bib file (from which the .bbl file % is produced).
% REMEMBER HOWEVER: After having produced the .bbl file,
% and prior to final submission, you *NEED* to 'insert'
% your .bbl file into your source .tex file so as to provide
% ONE 'self-contained' source file.

%
% You need the command \numberofauthors to handle the "boxing"
% and alignment of the authors under the title, and to add
% a section for authors number 4 through n.
%
% Up to the first three authors are aligned under the title;
% use the \alignauthor commands below to handle those names
% and affiliations. Add names, affiliations, addresses for
% additional authors as the argument to \additionalauthors;
% these will be set for you without further effort on your
% part as the last section in the body of your article BEFORE
% References or any Appendices.

\numberofauthors{1}
%
% You can go ahead and credit authors number 4+ here;
% their names will appear in a section called
% "Additional Authors" just before the Appendices
% (if there are any) or Bibliography (if there
% aren't)

% Put no more than the first THREE authors in the \author command
\author{
%
% The command \alignauthor (no curly braces needed) should
% precede each author name, affiliation/snail-mail address and
% e-mail address. Additionally, tag each line of
% affiliation/address with \affaddr, and tag the
%% e-mail address with \email.

\maketitle
\begin{abstract}

The paper suggests an approach to create structured OSC messages, separating the addressing of computers and modules, from the parameters and attributes of the modules. This includes a system for querying values and parameters for creating flexible communication in modular systems. A prototype implementation is presented and discussed.

\section{Introduction}

Jamoma\footnote{http://www.jamoma.org} is a system for developing high-level modules in the Max/MSP/Jitter environment, consisting of a recommendation and an implementation of that recommendation  \cite{Place:2006}. Most of the recent development of Jamoma has focused on improving core functionality, including flexible mapping between modules and adding ramping, function and unit conversion possibilities. 

Communication in and between Jamoma modules is being handled through the Open Sound Control (OSC)\footnote{http://www.opensoundcontrol.org} protocol. As the messaging between has grown more complex we have found that the current messaging structure of OSC is not ideal for our usage. The paper will start with an overview of some related research into development of the OSC protocol. This is followed by a suggestion for a structured approach to extending the current suggestions for OSC namespace creation. Finally, a prototype implementation in Jamoma is presented and discussed.

\subsection{Open Sound Control}

Open Sound Control (OSC) was developed in the late 1990s at CNMAT and has emerged as the de facto standard for communication among computers, sound synthesizers, and other multimedia devices in the computer music research community \cite{Wright:2003}. 


The original idea of OSC is that it is tree-structured into a hierarchy called the \emph{address space} where each of the nodes has a symbolic name and is a potential destination of OSC messages \cite{Wright:2003}. Oppositely to the well-defined structure of MIDI, the \emph{open} nature of OSC means that the address space is defined and created by the "implementor’s idea of how these features should be organized." 



“/voices/3/freq” 

This open approach has made OSC useful in a number of different situations, but it is also probably the major reason that OSC has not gained a more widespread usage outside the computer music research community.

\subsection{Integra}

The Integra\footnote{http://www.integralive.org} project is a EU Culture 2000 project aiming at developing "a new software environment to make music with live electronics," and to modernise works that use old technology \cite{Bullock:2007}. Part of the development has been concerning creating a client/server model

\subsection{Open Sound Control 2.0 suggestion}

Developers of the Lemur multitouch interface presented a draft for a 2.0 version of Open Sound Control during an OSC developer meeting at NIME 2006 \cite{Jazzmutant:2006}, and has later changed the suggestion slightly \cite{Jazzmutant:2007}.

\subsection{UPF}

The MTG at Pompeu Fabra has developed TUIO, an OSC address space for handling data from the Reactable \cite{Kaltenbrunner:2005}.
