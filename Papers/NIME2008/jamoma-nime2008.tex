% This is "sig-alternate.tex" V1.3 OCTOBER 2002
% This file should be compiled with V1.6 of "sig-alternate.cls" OCTOBER 2002
%
% This example file demonstrates the use of the 'sig-alternate.cls'
% V1.6 LaTeX2e document class file. It is for those submitting
% articles to ACM Conference Proceedings WHO DO NOT WISH TO
% STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE SIGS (PUBS-BOARD-ENDORSED) STYLE.
% The 'sig-alternate.cls' file will produce a similar-looking,
% albeit, 'tighter' paper resulting in, invariably, fewer pages.
%
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex file (and associated .cls V1.6) produces:
%       1) The Permission Statement
%       2) The Conference (location) Info information
%       3) The Copyright Line with ACM data
%       4) NO page numbers
%
% as against the acm_proc_article-sp.cls file which
% DOES NOT produce 1) thru' 3) above.
%
% Using 'sig-alternate.cls' you have control, however, from within
% the source .tex file, over both the CopyrightYear
% (defaulted to 2002) and the ACM Copyright Data
% (defaulted to X-XXXXX-XX-X/XX/XX).
% e.g.
%\CopyrightYear{2005}   %will cause 2002 to appear in the copyright line.
%\crdata{XXX}   %will cause XXX to appear in the copyright line.
%
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex source is an example which *does* use
% the .bib file (from which the .bbl file % is produced).
% REMEMBER HOWEVER: After having produced the .bbl file,
% and prior to final submission, you *NEED* to 'insert'
% your .bbl file into your source .tex file so as to provide
% ONE 'self-contained' source file.
%
% ================= IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS =======================
% Questions regarding the SIGS styles, SIGS policies and
% procedures, Conferences etc. should be sent to
% Adrienne Griscti (griscti@acm.org)
%
% Technical questions _only_ to
% Gerald Murray (murray@acm.org)
% ===============================================================

% For tracking purposes - this is V1.3 - OCTOBER 2002

% You need the command \numberofauthors to handle the "boxing"
% and alignment of the authors under the title, and to add
% a section for authors number 4 through n.
%
% Up to the first three authors are aligned under the title;
% use the \alignauthor commands below to handle those names
% and affiliations. Add names, affiliations, addresses for
% additional authors as the argument to \additionalauthors;
% these will be set for you without further effort on your
% part as the last section in the body of your article BEFORE
% References or any Appendices.

\numberofauthors{1}
%
% You can go ahead and credit authors number 4+ here;
% their names will appear in a section called
% "Additional Authors" just before the Appendices
% (if there are any) or Bibliography (if there
% aren't)

% Put no more than the first THREE authors in the \author command
\author{
%
% The command \alignauthor (no curly braces needed) should
% precede each author name, affiliation/snail-mail address and
% e-mail address. Additionally, tag each line of
% affiliation/address with \affaddr, and tag the
%% e-mail address with \email.

% produce the bibliography for the citations in your paper.
\bibliographystyle{abbrv}
\bibliography{sigproc}  % sigproc.bib is the name of the Bibliography in this case
% You must have a proper ".bib" file
