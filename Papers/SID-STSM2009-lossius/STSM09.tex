% \section{Style Stuff - delme}

% \subsection{Title and Authors}

%The title is 14pt Times, bold, caps, upper case, centered. Authors' names are centered. 
%The lead author's name is to be listed first (left-most), and the co-authors' names after. If the addresses for all 
%authors are the same, include the address only once, centered. If the authors have different addresses, 
%put the addresses, evenly spaced, under each authors' name.

% Reviews are double-blind. {\it \textbf{Author information should be removed from this page in initial submissions}}, 
% and only added later by the authors when sending camera-ready versions.

%\subsection{Figures, Tables and Captions}

%All artwork must be centered, neat, clean, and legible. All lines should
%be very dark for purposes of reproduction and art work should not be hand-drawn.
%The proceedings is not in color, and therefore all figures must make
%sense in black-and-white form.
%Figure and table numbers and captions always appear below the figure. Leave 1
%line space between the figure or table and the caption. Each figure or table
%is numbered consecutively. Captions should be Times 10pt.
%Place tables/figures in text as close to the reference as possible.
%References to figures and tables should be capitalised, for example:
%see Figure \ref{fig:example} and Table \ref{tab:example}.
%Figures and tables may extend across both columns to a maximum
%width of 7'' (17.78~cm).

%\begin{table}
%\begin{center}
%\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
%\hline
%String value & Numeric value \\
%\hline
%hello SMC  & 1073 \\

%\end{tabular}
%\end{center}
%\caption{Table captions should be placed below the table}
%\label{tab:example}
