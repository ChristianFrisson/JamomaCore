Focus of the paper:
flexible working environment for spatialization 

Arguments: 
1)  work with spatialization is often very experimental and depends on acoustical and technical conditions
2) Consequently, artists working with spatialization need a flexible environment that allow exploring different rendering techniques "ad hoc" as well as on-site fine-tuning (and also rapid prototyping or ability to swicth fast from one to another in creative working processes pressed for time - I guess that's what you've said better already...)
2.1) storing settings independently from spatial positions of sound sources and loudspeakers
    Benefits:
    - to compare
    - interchangeablity
    - adaptable to different development and performance situations
    - easier to create audio documentation of works 
    This implisitely mean that we are more interested in spatialisation algorithms where this is possible, rather than e.g. directly working with 5.1


Strategies for standardization of interfaces:
- SpatDIF
- Standardised GUI interfaces
- modular approach: 
    - positioning of sources and speakers defined independently of algorithms
    - modular algorithm (air, doppler, ...
    - mixing of rendering techniques (e.g. some sounds rendered with VBAP and some with Ambisonics)
Controlling: - mapping from gestural controller and interfaces to spatialization parameter (interactive media ?)
             - Holo-edit bridge: to compose spatial scenes in a sequencer like environment 
    - having one familiar composition interface whereas the underlying renderer is exchangable  



Implementations:
- multicable thing
- datapace thing
- 



Chat part:
---------

I think that once we have layed out the motivating problems and approaches, we can discuss or list implementations in Jamoma, along the way that you suggest in chapt. 2 (taxonomy) of the teex document

Should the controlling part be done according to the layout you suggested in the tex?
- rendering modules
- control modules
- etc.?

hmmmm, we can change that
I hink that once 


I think also Marlons approach might be intersting in terms of that paper:
- rendering B-format in OpenMusic
- and playback of B-format files in Max with Jamoma, where he can adapt for the current technical and acoustiacal situation 
- he also works on a binaural module for Ambisonics in Jamoma
