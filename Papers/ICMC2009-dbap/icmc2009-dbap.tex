\begin{abstract}
Most common techniques for spatialization require the listener to be positioned at a ``sweet spot'' surrounded by loudspeakers. For practical concert, stage and installation applications such layouts may not be undesirable. Distance-Based Amplitude Panning (DBAP) offers an alternative panning-based spatialization method where no assumptions are made concerning the layout of the speaker array nor the position of the listener.  DBAP is implemented both as an external for Max/MSP and as a module for the Jamoma framework.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}

Multichannel and surround sound reproduction is becoming more common, both for consumer applications as well as for musical and artistic purposes. A number of techniques exist for virtual positioning of sound sources using an array of loudspeakers.  Techniques for spatialization commonly assume that the position of a listener is known and fixed, and that the speakers are surrounding the listener either on a two-dimensional ring or a three-dimensional sphere. Examples of such speaker layouts and spatialization techniques are stereo panning, 5.1-channel surround \cite{ITU:1993_surround_5:1}, further extended industrial multichannel configurations \cite{Rumsey:2001spatial_audio}, Vector-Based Amplitude Panning (VBAP) \cite{Pulkki:1997vbap}, as well as both first-order and higher-order ambisonics \cite{Gerzon:1974surround, Poletti:2000holographic_sound}.

Wave field synthesis (WFS) is a noticeable exception to the aforementioned ``sweet spot'' restriction, reproducing signals resulting in a large listening area. The spatial properties of the acoustical scene can be perceived correctly by an arbitrarily large number of listeners regardless of their position inside this area \cite{Spors:2004sound_field_synthesis}.

A number of practical limitations tend to restrict what spatialization techniques are feasible for musical and artistic use.

Due to the high number of loudspeakers required, WFS might be impractical to use for financial reasons as well as time constraints unless one is working on a site where a permanent setup for wave field synthesis is installed

For real-time music and sound purposes, the relatively low CPU requirements of matrix-based spatialization techniques seem to make them popular choices. VBAP as well as ambisonics are readily available for use in common software environments for real-time processing such as Max/MSP \cite{Pulkki:2000vbap_max, Schacher:2006ambi_max, Neukom:2008ambipan}.

Among the requirements imposed by VBAP and ambisonics, are that the listeners are restricted to a relatively small listening area surrounded by loudspeakers.  These requirements might be unfeasible or undesired in practical applications.  In the ideal concert situation the entire audience should have a detailed impression of the spatial content of the music, not limiting the impression to those sitting in the middle of the concert hall. In a sound installation context one might want the audience to be able to move around the space \cite{lossius:2008installations}.  Finally, for pragmatic and/or artistic reasons it might not be possible or desired to have loudspeakers arranged in a ring or a sphere.

Distance-Based Amplitude Panning (DBAP) is a matrix-based spatialization technique that takes the actual positions of the speakers in space as the point of departure, while making no assumptions as to where the listeners are situated. This makes DBAP useful for a number of real-world situations including music for concerts, works for stage, installations, and museum sound design where predefined geometric speaker layouts might not apply.

\section{Distance-Based Amplitude Panning}

\subsection{Fundamentals}

% TODO: Tim changed the capitalization above -- but here it is again.  They should be the same, so what should it be?
% CHANGED: Tim changed a couple of places where the word 'setup' was used.  This is a bit colloquial.  I replaced it with the word 'model'.  Discard or consider as appropriate. 

\textit{Distance-Based Amplitude Panning (DBAP)} extends the principle of equal intensity panning from a pair of speakers to a loudspeaker array of any size, with no \textit{a priori} assumptions about their positions in space or relative to each other.
For simplicity, the method will be discussed in terms of a two-dimensional model with speakers and sources all positioned in the same horizontal plane. This can be readily extended to three dimensions.

The position of a virtual source will be described in terms of Cartesian coordinates $(x_{s}, y_{s})$. For a model with $N$ speakers, the position of the $i$th speaker is given as $(x_{i}, y_{i})$. The distance from a source to each of the speakers can then be calculated as

\begin{equation} \label{eq:distance}
d_{i} = \sqrt{ {(x_{i} - x_{s})}^2 + {(y_{i} - y_{s})}^2 } \qquad \textrm{for } 1 \leq i \leq N \textrm{ .}
\end{equation}

For simplicity, the source is presumed as having unity amplitude. DBAP then makes two assumptions. The first is that intensity is to be constant regardless of the position of the virtual source. This can be considered an extension of the principle of constant intensity panning for stereo to multichannel setups. If the amplitude of the $i$th speaker is $v_{i}$, this implies

\begin{equation} \label{eq:constant_intensity}
I = \sum_{i=1}^{N} {v_{i}}^2 = 1
\end{equation}

Secondly, it is assumed that all speakers are active at all times, and the relative amplitude of the $i$th speaker depends on the distance from the virtual source as 

\begin{equation} \label{eq:inverse_distance}
v_{i} = \frac{k}{2 d_{i} a} 
\end{equation}

% TODO: Tim notes that 'depending' isn't quite the right word in this sentence.  In both places it should be a different word (not certain about the replacement yet)
where $k$ is a coefficient depending on the position of the source and all speakers, while $a$ is a coefficient calculated from the rolloff $R$ in decibels per doubling of distance:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:rolloff}
	a = 10^{\frac{-R}{20}}
\end{equation}

A rolloff of $R = 6$ dB equals the inverse distance law for sound propagating in a free field. For closed or semiclosed environments $R$ will generally be lower, in the range 3-5 dB, and depending on reflections and reverberation \cite{Everest:2000handbook_acoustics} (pp. 84-88). In these circumstances (\ref{eq:rolloff}) represents a simplified description of attenuation with distance, but simulation of reflections and reverberation is anyway beyond the scope of an amplitude-panning based spatialization method.

%The second is based on the inverse distance law for sound pressure for sound propagating in free field as discussed in section \ref{distance_hearing}. DBAP applies an adaption of this by assuming that the relative amplitude for each speaker is inversely proportional to the distance from source to speaker:

Combining equations (\ref{eq:constant_intensity}) and (\ref{eq:inverse_distance}) $k$ can be found as:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:calculate_k}
k = \frac{2a}{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{1}{{d_{i}}^2}}}
\end{equation}




\subsection{Spatial blur}

If the virtual source is located at the exact position of one of the loudspeakers, (\ref{eq:calculate_k}) will cause a division by zero. Combining equations (\ref{eq:inverse_distance}) and (\ref{eq:calculate_k}) we get

\begin{equation}
v_{j} = \frac{1}{\sum_{i=0}^{N} \frac{{d_{j}}^2}{{d_{i}}^2}}
\end{equation}

From this it can be shown that

\begin{equation} \label{eq:distance_zero}
\lim_{d_{j} \rightarrow 0} v_{i} = 
\left\{ \begin{array}{ll} 
1 & \textrm{if $i=j$}\\ 
0 & \textrm{if $i \ne j$}
\end{array} \right.
\end{equation}

When the virtual source is located at the exact position of one of the loudspeakers, only that speaker will be emitting sound. This may cause unwanted changes in spatial spread and coloration of a virtual source in a similar way as observed for VBAP \cite{Pulkki:1999vbap}. To adjust for this a similar solution can be provided by introduction of a degree of \textit{spatial blur} $r_{s} \ge 0$ in equation (\ref{eq:distance}):

\begin{equation} \label{eq:mod_distance}
d_{i} = \sqrt{ {(x_{i} - x_{s})}^2 + {(y_{i} - y_{s})}^2 + {r_{s}}^2}
\end{equation}

In two dimensions the blur coefficient $r_{s}$ can be understood as a displacement in vertical position introduced between the source and the speakers. The larger $r$ gets, the less the source will be able to gravitate towards one speaker only. There is a limitation, however, to how blurred the sources can be perceived.  Practical experience indicates that the precedence effect \cite{Litovsky:1999precedence_effect} will come into play as blur is increased, causing the perceived direction of the source to gravitate towards the speaker(s) closest to the listener.

In the implementation of DBAP discussed in section \ref{sec:implementation} the blur coefficient is normalized, using the covariance of distance from centre of loudspeaker rig to loudspeakers as scaling factor, in order to make the blur coefficient less sensitive to changes in size of loudspeaker layouts.

% TODO: Discuss variance



\subsection{Sources positioned beyond the field of speakers}

The presuppositions upon which DBAP is based do not hold true when sources move outside of the field of speakers. As the distance of a source position from a loudspeaker increases, the relative difference in distance from source to each of the loudspeakers diminishes, resulting in progressively less difference in levels between the loudspeakers.  This occurs in much the same manner as discussed for spatial blur in the previous subsection. To compensate for this, additional steps needs to be taken when the source moves outside the field of loudspeakers.

From the description of loudspeaker positions the \emph{convex hull} of the field of loudspeakers is calculated. In two dimensions the convex hull ``is the shape taken by a rubber band stretched around nails bounded into the plane at each point'' \cite{Rourke:1998_geometry}.

For each source position it is first determined if the source is outside the hull or not. If it is inside or on the boundary no additional steps needs to be taken. If the source is positioned outside the convex hull, the projection of the point onto the boundary of the hull is calculated, defined as the point on the boundary with the shortest possible distance to the source. The source position is then substituted for the projected point on the hull in subsequent DBAP calculations. In addition, the distance from the source position to the convex hull is returned. This value can be used for optional added spatial processing such as gain attenuation, air filtering, Doppler effect, or gradual introduction of reverb with increasing distance from the hull.




\subsection{Extending DBAP by introducing spatial weights}

In the discussions thus far, the DBAP algorithm has dealt with the speakers in a transparent manner, with the aim of reproducing virtual sound sources in the best way possible without any further considerations for any loudspeaker properties apart from position.

The extension of DBAP by introduction of a spatial weight $w_{i}$ in equation \ref{eq:inverse_distance} enables a source to be restricted to use a subset of speakers:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:inverse_distance_weighed}
v_{i} = \frac{k w_{i}}{2 d_{i} a} 
\end{equation}

Equation \ref{eq:calculate_k} will now be modified to:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:calculate_k_weighted}
k = \frac{2a}{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{{w_{i}}^2}{{d_{i}}^2}}}
\end{equation}

This might offer several artistic possibilities. 

For instance, within the tradition of the Acousmonium \cite{Bayle:1993MusiqueAcousmatique} a large number of speakers are used, sorted in several groups with different qualities and characteristics, thus allowing a scripting of sound space according to the spectral content of the projected music \cite{Prager:2002acousmatique}. If the loudspeaker setup consists of different kinds of speakers with differing spectral properties, they can be thought of as an orchestra of speakers and be organized into different instrumental groups. Spatial weights can then be used to ensure that a source is spatialized among members of one group only. This allows a timbral and spatial orchestration to be prepared or composed prior to performance, and then be adjusted to the specific room used for playback \cite{Lyon:2008spatial_orchestration}. 

In installations or museum spaces spatial weights can also be used to confine sources to restricted areas. For instance one source can be diffused in one room only while another source with a different set of spatial weights might be permitted to move between several or all rooms.

Spatial weights can be changed dynamically, thus allowing smooth transitions from one state to another. 

This weight parameter, after being submitted to listening tests and visualization (as described later in \ref{sec:visual_representation}), has revealed itself as being more of a spatial weight for each loudspeaker, or rather a spatial ``sharpness'' of the localization of each loudspeaker. This parameter, though, needs further research and listening tests, in laboratory and artistic contexts for a better understanding of its perceptual effect.

The authors are also exploring a means by which to obtain a better numerical representation of this parameter.  In particular the parameter's range and transfer function. Research is ongoing to find a more intuitive process for the user by which to manage the interdependence of all weights.

\section{Implementation and visualization}

\subsection{Implementation}
\label{sec:implementation}

DBAP is implemented as an external for the real-time multimedia graphical environment Max/MSP \cite{Puckette:1988patcher, Zicarelli:1998} written in C as a part of the Jamoma library and framework \cite{Place:2006jamoma}. In addition to the features discussed already, the input gain of each source can be controlled prior to the DBAP processing, and each source can be muted.  In addition a Jamoma DBAP module is developed with a similar interface as other Jamoma spatialization modules for e.g. VBAP and ambisonics, according to the SpatDIF initiative \cite{Peters:2008spatdif}.



\subsection{Visual representations}
\label{sec:visual_representation}

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{LoudspeakerPositions}}
\caption{{\it Points represent positions of the 16 speakers used in the examples below}}
\label{speaker_positions}
\end{figure}

In order to provide users with an intuitive understanding of the algorithm, a visual representation of the behavior of the algorithm has been developed, using gradients to represent the ``predominance'' zone of each speaker. This is also intended to give a more intuitive manipulation of source positions, as well as management of parameters such as spatial blur, rolloff and spatial weights.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{spk4_r_6_b_0}}
\caption{{\it Representation of the levels 2D distribution for speaker 4. Parameter values are $6$ dB for roll off, and $0$ for blur}}  
\label{fig:1spk}
\end{figure}

% Does this look better ?
% Tim says 'yes, good enough for now'

The method for creating this visualization consists in creating a graphical map of level response for each loudspeaker as a 2D matrix of levels. For each pixel of this matrix, the pixel value is set to the squared amplitude returned by the dbap algorithm if the source was located at this position. The visual result in figure \ref{fig:1spk} indicates the spatial response for one of the loudspeakers. The lighter pixels are positions where amplitudes are close to $1$ and the darker ones are positions where amplitudes are close to $0$. As expected, the further away the source is from the loudspeaker, the lower the amplitude. 
%However the presence of holes in the spatial distribution of the amplitude response illustrates how the DBAP algorithm works when a source moves between several loudspeakers.
%This part above isn't really necessary

% CHANGED: Tim may not know what he is talking about, but he thinks the numbers for the dB values look odd in the PDF.  The 6 dB in particular.  Ignore if you think he's nuts. Pascal agrees and suggests removing the dollar signs just in case it could look better, so he'll try that out, and let's see how it turns out

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{all_r_2_b_0}}
\caption{{\it Representation of the 2D distribution of levels for all speakers. Parameter values are 2 dB for rolloff, and 0 for blur}}  
\label{fig:allspk1}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{all_r_6_b_0}}
\caption{{\it Representation of the 2D distribution of levels for all speakers. Parameter values are 6 dB for rolloff, and 0 for blur}}  
\label{fig:allspk2}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{all_r_6_b_0_2}}
\caption{{\it Representation of the 2D distribution of levels for all speakers. Parameter values are 6 dB for rolloff, and 0.2 for blur}}  
\label{fig:allspk3}
\end{figure}

A visualization of the response ranges for all speakers can be created by combining all figures of the same class as in fig. \ref{fig:1spk}, and then finding the maximum amplitude for a given 2D-position. The graphical result shows segmented parts in space corresponding to every spatial zone of predominance for each loudspeaker. Here the darker pixels have to be explained as positions where the source is mixed equally between the closest loudspeakers. Figures \ref{fig:allspk1}, \ref{fig:allspk2} and \ref{fig:allspk3} illustrate several combinations of varying roll off and blur values. 

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{spk_groups}}
\caption{{\it Representation of the 2D distribution of levels for 5 speakers only, with weights $[1.5,1.,1.,1.,0.75,1.2]$ for speakers $[5,8,9,10,11,12]$}}  
\label{fig:5spk_weights}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:5spk_weights} illustrates a weights preset that keeps only five loudspeakers set with different weights for each of them.

These pictures are generated in realtime by the algorithm, and can thus be used as a user-interface for source positioning, e.g. as back drops for mouse interaction, or even better for tactile-screen interaction.



\section{Conclusions and further work}

DBAP offers a light-weigh panning-based solution for spatialization that works for irregular loudspeaker layouts. The Jamoma module implementation makes DBAP available alongside modules for VBAP and ambisonics modules, enabling techniques to be interchanged and compared. Jamoma also offers a more advanced spatialisation technique that can be used for irregular loudspeaker layouts, ViMiC, incorporating distance-based signal delays between speakers, simulation of microphone patterns, early reflections and surface absorption \cite{Peters:2008vimic}. ViMiC is more CPU-intensive, and might require a dedicated computer for spatialization or limitations on the number of loudspeakers used as compared to DBAP.

Implementations of convex hulls and spatial weights remains to be done for three-dimensional loudspeaker layouts. If spatial weights are used to define subspaces of speakers, it also remains to be investigated if and how the implementation of convex hulls can be dynamically reconfigured.

In this paper DBAP has been discussed used for spatialisation to a static layout of speakers. For gaming applications the speaker layout relative to the player could be defined, and then the actual speaker layout could be changed dynamically as the gamer moves through the virtual world of the game.

DBAP can also be used as a solution for dynamic routing of input sources to a spacial layout of effect processes. Instead of defining loudspeaker positions, the effects could be assigned positions in two or more spaces. The idea of having sources traverse a space of effects would resemble  e.g. the work by \cite{Momeni:2003hipnoscope}. A project for designing multi-touch graphical interfaces to intuitively interact with DBAP has been initiated.
