/**

	We build a tree of nodes, and you can request a pointer for any node, or add an observer to any node, etc.
	
	Every time we create a node (or a string passed to something somewhere?) then this gets added to the tree.  
	If a node is specified, such as /degrade~/audio/mute, 
	and we assume degrade~ has been added to the tree but 'audio' hasn't, then 'audio' is added followed by adding 'mute', 
	so that the tree is properly completed.
	
	
	
	When a node is requested, the tree is traversed to find the pointer for the node.  
	After the traversal (assuming no wildcards) the pointer is returned and also stored 
	in a hash table so that future requests for that node are faster.
	
	The case of wildcards is handled, because a request is cached (keyed on the request),
	and the value is a linked list of all of the matches.
	
	
	
	ADDITIONAL NODES:
	
	One tricky part of this design is that observers need to be recursive -- so they need to report all activity for the specific node, 
	but any activity at sub-nodes will also need to be propagated upwards to notify any observers at higher levels too

	jcom.receive is then implemented as an observer for a specified node.
	jcom.send registers as a lifecycleObserver, but then otherwise sends messages to the nodeObject.
