/**	A State Variable Filter object.
	One of the features of a state variable filter is that it can provide all 4 filter types 
	simultaneously from the same algorithm.
	
	This implementation takes a different approach which requires the selection of one of the types.
	At some point in the future we could add a mode to get all 4 signals out of the output...
