// Class Specification


/**
	The TTSymbol class is used to represent a string and efficiently pass and compare that string.
	At the moment the implementation is somewhat crude and really slow and it should be improved in the future.

	This current implementation has an internal table that is implemented as a fixed array.
	Each symbol is identified by its index in this array.
