// Class Specification

/**
	The TTSymbol class is used to represent a string and efficiently pass and compare that string.
	At the moment the implementation is somewhat crude and really slow and it should be improved in the future.
 
	Note that generally speaking you should not create a TTSymbol.  Instead, TTSymbol objects should only
	by created by the TTSymbolTable that you are using.  Because of this we *always* pass TTSymbols as
	pointers into the symbol table rather than as references or copies.
