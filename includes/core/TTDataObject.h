// Class Specification

/**	TTDataObject is the base class for all asynchronous data generating and processing objects in TTBlue.
 *	
	The object processes messages and attributes like any other TTObject.
	However, this notion is extended by adding the concept of additional inlets and outlets.
	Inlets and outlets are registered in the constructor.
 
 
 
 *	The theory of operation is that this class handles the public interface to any subclass,
 *	including the main processing method, which calls an appropriate method through a function pointer.
 *	By default, this points to the built-in bypassProcess().  Subclasses then set it to point to their 
 *	own process() method(s) as needed.
