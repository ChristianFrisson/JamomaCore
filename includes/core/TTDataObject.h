// Class Specification

/**	TTDataObject is the base class for all asynchronous data generating and processing objects in TTBlue.
	It still has knowledge and support for sample-rates, but not channel counts or vector processing.
	
	The object processes messages and attributes like any other TTObject.
	However, this notion is extended by adding the concept of additional inlets and outlets.
	Inlets and outlets are registered in the constructor.

	NOTE [TAP] 2008/06/28 -- I'm not really sure what I had in mind by the above, and it doesn't seem to be implemented
	Instead it seems like we should just declare a process() method that takes a TTValue& input and a TTValue& output.
