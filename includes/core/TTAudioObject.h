// Class Specification

/**	TTAudioObject is the base class for all audio generating and processing objects in TTBlue.
 *	
 *	The theory of operation is that this class handles the public interface to any subclass,
 *	including the main processing method, which calls an appropriate method through a function pointer.
 *	By default, this points to the built-in bypassProcess().  Subclasses then set it to point to their 
 *	own process() method(s) as needed.
