Jamoma Modular
Modular Framework for Max (and Max-like) Environments
_________________________________________________________________


Introduction
Jamoma Modular is an open source framework currently implemented for the Max/MSP environment.  It makes managing complex structures fun, powerful, and friendly.


Installing
- Users run the Installer from the Jamoma.org website 
- Developers run the build.rb script in the Jamoma/Tools folder

The Jamoma distribution depend on certain 3rd party externals. For simplicity we have chosen to include these externals as part of the distribution. If you already have installed some or all of these externals, make sure that that the Jamoma distribution do not introduce older versions of the externals than you have already. All such externals can be found in the Jamoma/library/third-party folder.


Documentation / API
Doxygen generated documentation is located in the "documentation" folder.
