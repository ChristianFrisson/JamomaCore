The Jamoma Tools folder contains scripts which perform various essential tasks for the development of Jamoma.


BUILDING THE SOURCE CODE
This build.rb Ruby script builds all of the C/C++ code required for Jamoma's Framework and Externals.

To use the script:
build.rb <required:configuration> <optional:clean>

If you want a nice, clean release version, try this: 
	./build.rb Deployment clean

or a developer release (without cleaning), try this: 
	./build.rb Development




MAKING AN INSTALLER
The installer.rb Ruby script collects all of the files it needs and then generates a standard Mac installer.

If you want to make an installer, then follow these instructions:
1. do a clean deployment build (above)
2. all zips should be unzipped (3rd-party externs) too
3. ./installer.rb




SETTING UP AUTOMATED TESTS

To run the automated tests, you must have rosc installed.  This is a library that implements OSC support for Ruby.
The version we are using is included in the Tools/rosc folder.  To install it:
1. cd to the Tools/rosc folder
2. sudo ruby setup.rb

Now you are ready to run automated tests, as described below.



RUNNING AUTOMATED TESTS

Automated tests are started by running the following script (after cd'ing into the Tools folder)
	./testrunner.rb

This relies on the 'test-components' folder in the Jamoma/library folder.
The test components need to be in that location, because they need to be in Max's searchpath.

The tests themselves are located in the 'Tests' folder at the top level of the branch.
