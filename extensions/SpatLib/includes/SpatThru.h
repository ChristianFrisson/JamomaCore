 * @brief Super simple through-putting spatialization object for Jamoma DSP
 *
 * @details This unit simply throughputs whatever comes in.
 * As a real-world spatialisation technique that is pretty much useless, but 
 * it could be considered a bypassing method, and it is also useful while
 * developing this library in order to first implement simple-stupid units
 * before delving into the real spatialisation renderers.
