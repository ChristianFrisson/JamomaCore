	The old TTQueue class (circa 2008) was unused, and was designed specificaly to be used only for getting things
	from an other thread onto the main thread.
 
	The new TTQueue class is more general, and is designed as a non-blocking circular buffer for getting
	events from thread A to thread B where the neither of the threads are required to be the main thread.
 
	A specific use of this queue to get things to the main thread can be created and would then use this
	newer version of the class.

	Instead of sending a message directly to an object, it can be sent to the queue.  The queue
	will then send the message to the object from the queue's thread when the queue is serviced.
	
	The implementation uses a set of related lists; one for the object, one for the message, and
	one for the value argument to the message.

	The TTQueue class implements a non-blocking circular queue for passing events across threads.
	The items in the queue are TTValues.
	What is contained in the TTValue will be specific to whatever is using the queue.
 
	This is based on "Efficient Adaptations of Non-Blocking Buffer for Event Message Communication
	between Real-Time Threads" by Kim, Colmenares, and Rim from the proceedings of the 10th IEEE
	International Symposium on Object and Component-Oriented Real-Time Distributed Computing.
 
	One important difference is that we copy data at both the insert() and the read(), rather than 
	referencing a pointer at insert() and copying only at read().
	The reason for this is that we could easily put something on the queue (i.e. a reference to an object)
	that is temporary (alloc'd on the stack, for example) and then disappears prior to being serviced.
