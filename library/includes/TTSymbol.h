// Class Specification

/**
	The TTSymbol class is used to represent a string and efficiently pass and compare that string.
	At the moment the implementation is somewhat crude and really slow and it should be improved in the future.
 
	Note that generally speaking you should not directly create a TTSymbol!
	Instead, TTSymbol objects should only by created by the TTSymbolTable that you are using.  
	Because of this we *always* pass TTSymbols as pointers (#TTSymbolRef) into the symbol table rather than as references or copies.
 
	Also, if you don't need the fast lookup capabilities of the symbol table (such as for message or attribute lookup)
	then consider passing a #TTString instead.
