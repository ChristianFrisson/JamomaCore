/**	This object represents a single 'inlet' to a TTGraphObject.
	TTGraphObject maintains a vector of these inlets.
	
	The relationship of an inlet to other parts of the multicore heirarchy is as follows:

		A graph may have many objects.
		An object may have many inlets.	
		An inlet may have many signals connected.
		A signal may have many channels.
