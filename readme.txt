This project is the master project for the Jamoma platform.

It is intended to contain sub-projects representing the various modules of the Jamoma platform.
- Foundation
- Graphics
- DSP
- Multicore
- Modular



--------------------------------------------------

The Jamoma Tools folder contains scripts which perform various essential tasks for the development of Jamoma.


BUILDING THE SOURCE CODE
This "all.sh" script in the /buildtools folder builds all of the C/C++ code required for Jamoma's Framework and Externals.

To use the script:
sh all.sh <required:configuration> <optional:clean>

(close Max before doing that!)

If you want a nice, clean release version, try this: 
	sh all.sh Deployment clean (or Release clean)

or a developer release (without cleaning), try this: 
	sh all.sh Development (or Debug)

If you get an error such as:
	./jamomalib.rb:12:in `require': no such file to load -- osc (LoadError)
	from ./jamomalib.rb:12
	from ./build.rb:10:in `require'
	from ./build.rb:10

you have to update rosc:

1. just go to the rosc folder which is inside the Tools/library folder
	cd rosc
2. execute:
	sudo ruby setup.rb
3. go back to the previous folder:
	cd ..
4. try now to make the build


--------------------------------------------------

MAKING AN INSTALLER
The installer.rb Ruby script collects all of the files it needs and then generates a standard Mac installer.

If you want to make an installer, then follow these instructions:
1. do a clean deployment build (above)
2. all zips should be unzipped (3rd-party externs) too
3. go to /installertools folder
4. ./installer.rb


--------------------------------------------------


SETTING UP AUTOMATED TESTS

To run the automated tests, you must have rosc installed.  This is a library that implements OSC support for Ruby.
The version we are using is included in the Tools/rosc folder.  To install it:
1. cd to the Tools/rosc folder
2. sudo ruby setup.rb

Now you are ready to run automated tests, as described below.


--------------------------------------------------

RUNNING AUTOMATED TESTS

Automated tests are started by running the following script (after cd'ing into the Tools folder)
	./testrunner.rb

This relies on the 'test-components' folder in the Jamoma/library folder.
The test components need to be in that location, because they need to be in Max's searchpath.

The tests themselves are located in the 'Tests' folder at the top level of the branch, and all subfolders.
The script also looks in every folder of the Modules folder so that module tests can be kept together with the module.

DEBUGGING EXTERNALS ON THE MAC PLATFORM

The Max Runtime does not use the Max5 file preferences. The AddJamomaPath.maxpat is a handy utility for temporarily adding the Jamoma folder and all subfolders to the search path so that externals, components, algorithms modules and help files can be accessed in Max Runtime, e.g. when running the debugger and Max Runtime in Xcode on the OSX platform.
